# Barro’s Beatdown Patch Notes (2/22/26)
**Version 1.0 – “Run It Back” Update**

Welcome to the first update for **Barro’s Beatdown**! This patch focuses on venue feature changes, QOL improvements, awards, and exciting new events coming up.

## Venue

### 🎮 Tournament Setups
- All tournament setups have been updated and one has recently received a new hardware upgrade in the form of a new motherboard and CPU combo giving it some extra power to handle SF6 consistently.
- When plugging in a keyboard to play, you can toggle keyboard mode ON in the SF6 settings in OTHER SETTINGS. When leaving the setup, please turn it off to avoid any controller difficulties for the next match.

### ⚡Power
We've had two instances of the power going out at the beginning of our tournaments. Since Barro's Beatdown 11, we have been hard at work brainstorming ways to prevent it from happening again. Ensuring the tournament runs smoothly is a big priority for us and prevents matches from needing to be replayed.

- Each tournament setup now has its own breaker. This means that no single breaker will need to withstand more power draw than it can handle. This will prevent any breakers from tripping due to high power usage.
- We are working on adding string lights in the patio area for better lighting and accessibility during the night. More info coming soon.

### 🎮 Controller Policy
- Brook adapters and similar third-party adapters are allowed but must be tournament-approved.
- Turbo and macro functions remain strictly banned.
- Wireless controllers must be synced prior to match start — desync penalties enforced.

## Online Events

We are overwhelmed by the support from the community and seeing everybody come out our tournament in huge numbers. Barro's Beatdown 11 was our absolute biggest event yet and we can't wait to see you all again. However, we also want to provide some small online events occasionally during the downtimes.

Many of you have already joined the Discord Server and often meet up in our voice channels to play. We want to use those more by hosting some online events with prizes that you can redeem at our in-person events.

In no way will these events replace or take resources away from our in-person events. These will only be occasional when we feel that we have some extra time to run.

## Merch

We recently started giving away and selling a lot of merch for Barro's Beatdown including shirts and stickers. All of the funds from these sales go back into the tournament to make it better. Of course, we will still give away a lot of merch for the winners of the brackets and raffles. We have more coming soon so if you want to support and rep your locals, come talk to us about it!

## Beatdown Awards
We pride ourselves in rewarding our top players very well for putting in the work and dominating their brackets. However, we are introducing a few new things to highlight other players who have put in a lot of work as well and showing up at our local. Here are some awards we will be giving away in the future:

- Most Improved: This award is for players who have consistently competed at Barro's Beatdown and have shown big improvements over time by climbing their way through the bracket. We will be tracking player trends to see who has been persevering and showing real improvement in the way that they play.
- Most Hype Commentary: This award will be voted on by **YOU**. You get to determine which commentators have done the most to hype up the crowd and show why the FGC is something so great.
- Most Analytical Commentary: This award will be voted on by **YOU**. You get to determine which commentators have done the most to educate spectators and provide great analysis of high-level gameplay.

More awards are in the works and we would love to hear your suggestions! These awards will come at a later time TBD.
